Hi this is Pradyumna! This is a list of my current projects, previous work, and other accomplishments.

# Education 
I am studying Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, graduating in 2027. I'm also a member of the NUS College program which is a successor to the University Scholars Program.

# Milton (In progress)
- [Repo link]](https://github.com/pradyuprasad/milton). 
I am building an AI agent for macroeconomic research. The AI agent exhibits the following capacities
- It can split a complex task into multiple subtasks
- It can autonomously execute those tasks and await for user approval
- The tasks that the agent can do by itself are
  * search for datasets, rank them and extract relevant ones
  * based on the previously searched datasets, write code to answer the user's query
  * based on the answer from the previous steps, and the datasets selected, it can generate graphs relevant to the query

# Singapore Data Project
- [Repository link](https://github.com/pradyuprasad/Singapore-Data-Project). [Demo link](https://sgdataproject-frontend.onrender.com/).
- Built automated data query system for Singapore's economic data to make data querying easier for laymen.
- Made complex AI pipeline using HuggingFace classification API, code-writing LLMs and access to SingStat data.
- Build backend using FastAPI, and frontend graphing using d3.js
